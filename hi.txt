Tracking App

(STEP ONE BWATA)
Bare bones basic program that runs on android devices that only picks up coordinate data 
UI (on/off)
When on is clicked, coordinate data is logged (every 500 ms) 
When off is clicked, data logging stops and final mileage is recorded.

All data is stored on a database which will be used for analysis on dev systems

how to track:
    elevation
    acceleration
    speed
    distance


Optional (prototype map)
    possibly using google maps api, highlight the sidewalk areas (drop nodes using coordinate data and color it)
    this step is more like a test to check coordinate data and basic visualization
